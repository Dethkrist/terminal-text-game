This is a simple terminal-styled quest game made as a little project to learn javascript. Yes, code is not ideal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To play this game, just download all files, extract, and launch index.html.


You can inspect Terminal, look at every corner.

Just type in commands, which you see on the screen!

After opening and neutralizing virus using very strange decision, you will unlock more functions of Terminal, for example you can play a little text-quest story.

I hope you will enjoy it!
